RACE CONDITIONS
---------------
I used a simple rule - when different threads are trying to WRITE to the same variable, this variable should be locked/unlocked with a mutex. Pretty straightforward.



OTHER COLLABORATORS AND CITATIONS (if any):
This pset (like the pset4 and pset5) was done in collaboration with Ricardo Contreras HUID 30857194. 
But at some time we've got two versions of code, and decided to divide our job. So, that is why there migth be some pieces of code, written by him. On the other hand, I refactored the code so much that it might look completely different.


KNOWN BUGS (if any):



NOTES FOR THE GRADER (if any):
It seems that I got late - because of reading due date in European manner - I thought that 12/11 is 12th of December, so I could post the final version on the 13th. My fault.
It seems that I am late for 8 hours, but I hope you could grade it anyway.


EXTRA CREDIT ATTEMPTED (if any):
